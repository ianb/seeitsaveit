ScrapBook+:

Basically Save-As but managing the saved pages itself

Save a page (for offline):

Quick Note:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/quick-note/
Just like iPad notes.  Not really annotation.

Highlight web pages:
https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-highlighter-by-diigo/
Highlight anything.  Seems text-based; you can't highlight a small
piece of text, probably because it can't easily be matched on.  Stores
highlights locally.




Invert bookmarking: make a note about a page, search and view notes,
implicit bookmark; also turn into "read later"

Extensions able to present themselves in Firefox Home somehow; e.g.,
an extension with a bookmarklet version

Can we store things in Sync?  Can we publish/share out of Sync?
