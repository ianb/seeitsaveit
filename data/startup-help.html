<p>Thanks for checking out <a target="_blank"
href="https://seeitsaveit.vcap.mozillalabs.com">SeeItSaveIt</a>!</p>

<p>You should see this icon at the bottom right of the
browser: <img src="box-download.png"> &mdash; if you don't then you
need to show the Add-on Bar:</p>

<p>Go to <strong>View &gt; Toolbars &gt; Add-on bar</strong> to
display the bar
(or <a href="http://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/add-on-bar-quick-access-to-add-ons">read
more here</a>).</p>

<p>One you see the button, go to a site that you want to extract data
from, and develop your own extractor or maybe you'll encounter one
that someone else has developed.</p>
